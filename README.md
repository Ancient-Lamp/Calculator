# WinXP in Pure JS
I made this project because I challenged myself to make Windows XP without React, Node.js, or other JavaScript libraries
It is a version of Windows XP that has some features from other operative systems, kind of a merge of all the operative systems in history.
It will be able to run every type of files, from *.txt and *.rtf(rich text file) to *.exe and *.ttf(TrueType Font)

It now has one feature: Scientific Calculator.
But I will be adding features over time
